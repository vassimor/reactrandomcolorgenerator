# Getting Started with Create React App

Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- [ ] A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- [ ] Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` (the background color and the hex code must match)

Our suggestions for breaking down the task into TODOs:

- If you need a reminder of how to do this, watch the video showing breaking down tasks
- Read the [Breaking Down Tasks Into TODOs](https://learn.upleveled.io/pern-extensive-immersive-winter-2026-nlams/modules/tasks/#breaking-down-tasks-into-todos) page on the Learning Platform
- This time, you will need to think about design in the browser: Design the web app with a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or by sketching the design out on paper
- Come up with a detailed list of features you'll need for the application above
- For each of the features, write which dependencies, functions and React component(s) you'll need for them, if any
- Describe how each component will interact with the other components
- Identify any unknowns
